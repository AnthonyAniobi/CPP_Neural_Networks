# Neural Networks 

## A Machine Learning implementation using c++

### Description
This is an open source machine learning library. This library is built to be a replacement for popular general purpose machine learning libraries like tensorflow. 

Taking advantage of the computing speed and optimal memory management of the c++ programming language, this library promises a lightweight and very fast machine learning process. You can now train larger and deeper neural networks using the same hardware, Enjoy the benefits of rapid prototyping and fast tuning of hyper parameters.

## Capabilities
- [x] Simple Neural Network
- [ ] Matrix Neural Network
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Network
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network
- [x] File Reading and Data Analysis
- [ ] Graph Plotting

### Future work
This library intends to be used for processing in devices with lower computing and memory capabilities like: 
- Arduino
- Mobile devices
- Rasberry pi
